## Technique

The whole paper is written in R markdown. Markdown which is a lightweight
markup language. For a description of commands that are available in Markdown
see [here](http://markdown.de/syntax/). The R Markdown markup makes it easier
to handle the inclusion of the R packages commands and output. You can use
[R-Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to edit the document as it offers methods
to compile the document from R Markdown to markdown and then to other document
formats (e.g html) with the Knitr package.
