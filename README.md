## Technique

The whole paper is written in markdown, which is a lightweight markup language.
For a description of commands that are available see
[here](http://markdown.de/syntax/). The markdown markup makes it easier to
handle the inclusion of the R packages output. You can use
[R-Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to edit the document as it offers methods
to compile the document to markdown and other document formats (e.g html) with
the Knitr package.
