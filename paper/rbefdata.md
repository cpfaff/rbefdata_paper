## Abstract 

* Lots of data available
* Many accessible (with some hindrances) 
    - metadata missing (renders data useless)
* Many get still lost (needs help e.g rebind)
* Data often hard to find/use 

## Introduction 

Over the last decade ecology has grown into a more collaborative and
interdisciplinary science, to address questions on a greater temporal and
spatial scale (e.g michener et al 2012). With a growing awareness about the
value of data in the long run many efforts focused on building data platforms
ranging from small scales, covering a single project or collaboration, up to
global data bases and data warehouses (citation xx).  As it is harder to reuse
data without contextual information, many effort was also put into building up
standard frameworks that help to describe data like the Ecological Metadata
Language (cite xxx, other standards?). 

On characteristic of the data available in Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning
is high homogeneity and large dataset size. It is generated partly automated by
remote sensing projects (e.g. Collins2006) using sensor or satellite networks,
enabling researchers to gain almost real-time insight into measured processes
(e.g michener ecoinformatics 2012}. And on the other hand there is data
characterized by a relative small dataset size and a high amount of
heterogeneity which gets generated by small studies spread all over the world
(e.g heidorn2009shedding).

## Material and Methods 

### BEFdata portal

The BEFdata portal is a data management platform developed within the 
BEF-China project (FOR xxx) of the german science foundation. It offers 
tools for data harmonization...

### Data used

The data used for the presentation of this package stems from ...

### Rbefdata

The `rbefdata` package offers an option list that is used to determine 
the servers URLs the package contacts to to retrieve data, the download 
forlder name for attached freeformat content of a dataset and 

* load the package


```r
require(rbefdata)
```


* list options


```r
bef.options()
```

```

Introduction to the rbefdata R package

* get datasets 

In the very heart of the BEFdata portal there is a paper proposal process
integrated. You shop together datasets and afterwards create a paper proposal
based on the shopped dataset. In the proposal you have to give information like
a title for the proposal and a rationale describing how you intend to use the
data and where and when to publish the results. If the proposal is handed in
the authors will be informed that somebody likes to access their datasets and
they can decide if they like to participate and how. After all authors have
granted access on is good to go with the `rbefdata` package. One can draw all
datasets associated to a proposal in one turn with the package.


```r
dataset_list = bef.portal.get.datasets_for_proposal(id = 1)
```

```
## Error: Not Found
```

```r
extract_one_dataset = dataset_list[[1]]
```

```
## Error: object 'dataset_list' not found
```


* Inspect datasets

The BEFdata portal offers metadat in Ecological Metadata Language format
standard for download (cite EML). We make use of that metadata in the`rbefdata`
package as well and each dataset is associated with its metadata on download.
So you always have acces to the information that is required to understand a
dataset. This information can be extracted from a dataset with the R command
`attributes()`


```r
dataset_list = bef.portal.get.dataset_for_proposal(id = 1)
```

```
## Error: could not find function "bef.portal.get.dataset_for_proposal"
```

```r
attributes(dataset_list[[1]])$title
```

```
## Error: object 'dataset_list' not found
```

* write your scripts 




* vizualize the portal (keywords)
