## Abstract

In order to answer the most pressing questions in ecology, scientists need to
deal with the huge amount of environmental and historic data, that is already
available today. The effective employment and curation of this data requires
tools that not only foster the exploration but also the processing, the reuse
and the preparation of data for long term preservation. Although there is a rag
rug of data management tools and concepts already available that cover most of
the data management requirements in ecology, their tight integration into
widely used data analysis tools lacks behind. Thus we created an R package
named `rbefdata` that implements valuable data management concepts into the R
statistics environment. As companion package to the data management platform
`BEFdata`, it offers a dataset search, enhances the search feature by the
integration of an online thesaurus, enables a seamless access to datasets and
metadata for analysis as well as it provides upload functionality for data
preservation. The open source character of the data management platform
`BEFdata` and the companion package `rbefata` allow any project to use this
package as a sophisticated solution to their own data research data related
requirements. 

## Introduction 

With a growing awareness on the value of data, many data management platforms
have been developed to preserve all kinds of environmental and historic data.
These provide data preservation for small scale projects as well as for large
scale, big data producing, long term or remote sensing collaborations (cite
e.g.  diversity workbench, `BEFdata`, DataONE, LifeWatch, Pangea, Bexis). An
ongoing trend in data preservation and accessibility is integrative data
platforms that represent nodes (cite TRY, GBIF, Pangea) in a data network that
collect data from smaller databases and enable researchers to access a wide
range of data all from one place. These platforms offer a solution to one of
the most pressing general problems in data management, the loss of valuable
data (Heidorn, 2008). Even tough these platforms improve the situation in data
preservation, researchers are still reluctant to use them extensively as they
fear to give away and loose the control over their data (michener 2012).
Additionally there is no direct benefit of sharing data online that could
motivate researchers to put more time into data that is required to prepare and
upload it for sharing. The `rbefata` R package provides upload functionality
for datasets to the `BEFdata` portal for preservation. The `BEFdata` offers
control over the access to uploaded data via a fine grained access rights
system. Uploading data to the portal from within R sets the access rights to
private which gives access to the owner only. 

The demand to reuse available data grows with the amount of data available
(Heidorn, 2008). In ecology the reuse of data is of particular interest as the
integration of data offers the potential to answer questions on a much broader
temporal and spatial scale (michener, 2008). However a problem with the reuse
of data is, that available data is rarely well described. Metadata is crucial
here as plain primary research data can be hard to understand, and even hard to
decipher by the authors themselves after some time has passed. For example it
is hard to remember what methods have been used to collect the data of a
certain column or what the abbreviations and the headers in the dataset mean.
However metadata is still not used exhaustive as it usually means to put more
time into the data with no direct benefit and to learn new tools that help to
describe the data (e.g morpho, dataUP). Metadata gives researchers the
opportunity to describe their data and others to understand raw research data
even if they are not familiar with it (Fegraus 2005). The `BEFdata` portal
allows an upload of metadata as spreadsheet and exports it to the EML metadata
standard. The R package tightly integrates the metadata of datasets into
attributes of R data frames.

To find relevant data for reuse is a challenging task that is getting even more
complex if more data gets available (Leinfelder et al, xxx). A common practice
in data discovery, next to full text search in data and metadata, is the
tagging with keywords (Nadrowski 2013). However a keyword search can be very
coarse as the search for one specific keyword may cover a set of relevant data
but misses other essential and relevant data tagged with close related or
synonymous keywords (Leinfelder et al. xxx, michener 2008). For example an
exact search for the keywords "weight" and "leaves" will likely miss datasets
tagged with "dry weight", "wet weight" or "plant organs", that might be
associated to datasets that are of interest as well. The integration of
semantic repositories that provide taxonomies of terms can improve this. They
embed the keywords from the search query into a hierarchical structure and so
the query can be extended along known relations (Leinfelder et al.). Thus the
`rbefdata` package offers functionality to access semantic repositories stored
on `tematres` servers.

We here introduce the `rbefdata` R package as companion to the open source data
management platform `BEFdata` (Nadrowski 2013). The package is part of the
rOpenSci (http://ropensci.org/) initiative, a community driven project to
provide the R statistics environment (R Development Core Team 2008) with a
flexible access to scientific data repositories. The R package enables access
to data and metadata stored on a `BEFdata` platform, integrates semantic
repositories stored on `tematres` vocabulary servers
(http://www.vocabularyserver.com/) and provides data preservation functionality
for raw research data as well as for free format attachments files that are
generated while analysing data with R. We showcase the functionality of the
`rbefdata` package available with version 0.3.5. The R script we present shows
the semantic refinement of keywords to improve the search of datasets, the use
of metadata in data processing, how to access a complete set of data based on a
paper proposal of the BEF-China experiment, and finally the upload of the data
products. The R script shown here employs an analysis about N retention to
showcase the package. The results of the analysis have been published already
and the related data is open access (Lang et al. 2013). Thus the script shown
here is fully reproducible. 


## Material and Methods 

â€¢ Include sufficient details for the work to be repeated.

### The BEF-China project

The BEF (Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning) - China project, funded by the
German Science Foundation (DFG, FOR 891) is a research collaboration consisting
of 10-15 independent research groups (www.bef-china.de) with the overarching
aim to disentangle the role of tree and shrub diversity for production, erosion
control, element cycling, and species conservation in Chinese subtropical
forest ecosystems. The project uses two main research platforms located in the
provinces Jiangxi and Zhejiang in China (Bruelheide et al., 2012).

### The BEFdata platform

[BEFdata](http://befdataproduction.biow.uni-leipzig.de/) it the data management
platform of the BEF-China project. It that has been developed within the
project and it is is specialized in the management of small and heterogeneous
data typical for ecology related research. It offers data preservation in a
harmonized environment, fosters the exploration of data by a keyword tagging
and search system and adheres to the Ecological Metadata Lanuage standard
standard for describing preserved data. The platform additionally facilitates
research cooperations and discussions of ideas by a paper proposal tool. To
create a paper proposal a researcher can select datasets from the platform to
be included in an analysis. In the process of creating a proposal, basic
information like a title, a rationale, the envisaged journal and a date needs
to be provided. Submitting a proposal, a researcher asks data owner for access
to the selected data and proposes his research idea to the project board and
the data owners. The data owners can decide if they like to participate in the
upcoming analysis or if they only like to get acknowledged for providing their
data (Nadrowski 2013). This process allows to include or acknowledge all
researchers involved in the data sampling process. Thus the paper proposals on
the portal result in a direct benefit for providin data, they promote
collaborations between research units and help to avoid duplication in
publication initiatives on the same research ideas. Finally all datasets
assembled in a paper proposal can be imported into the R environment using the
`rbefdata` package. 

### Usecase: N retention along a biodiversity gradient 



We used a paper proposal from the BEF-China project as starting point to
showcase the interlinkages between the data management platform and the
`rbefdata` package. The proposal contains 3 datasets and deals with N retention
along a biodiversity gradient. The results to the paper proposal have been
published already elsewhere (A. Lang xxx) and the data is open access. For a
detailed rationale on the analysis we refer to the online resource of the
proposal (http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/paperproposals/90) as well
as to the publihed paper (A. Lang xxx).

        the attached datasets and sub-projects involved (only partially shown). The
        results of the underlying analysis of the proposal are published already and
        thus for a detailed insight we refer to Lang et al. 2013.

### the `tematres` thesaurus 

The `tematres` vocabulary server is an open source server software that offers
features to manage, share and publish formal representations of knowledge. The
`rbefdata` package can exploit vocabularies stored on `tematres` vocabulary
servers. It can search for terms, display their descriptions as well as it can
query the server for the relations of terms (broader, narrower). The `rbefdata`
package by default connects to a `tematres` server instance with a thesaurus
that, by the time of writing, contains round about 1000 terms which are related
to ecology and biodiversity research. We used the default thesaurus to retrieve
narrower keywords to a improve a keyword based search for datasets to highlight
a way on how the integration of semantic repositories can enhance the process
of data exploration on a `BEFdata` portal.

### Setup 

The latest version of `rbefdata` can be directly installed from the CRAN
repository. `rbefdata` offers a set of options that modify the behavior of the
R package. The options can be set or queried via the `bef.options()` command.
One of the most essential options is the user credentials. These are used to
authenticate the user against the platform and to ensure weather the access to
a specific datasets has been granted or not. Each user can find and change its
credentials on his profile page on the `BEFdata` platform. The other options in
the list represent the URLs to the `BEFdata` server instance and the `tematres`
vocabulary server as well as a field that stores the name for a download
folder. While the URL fields ensure the communication with the right servers,
the download folder name is used to create a folder in case of a download of
attached files from a dataset or paper proposal. The URL to the `BEFdata` and
the `tematres` server default to the BEF-China project instances that are used
in this paper to retrieve data from. If an own instance of either the `BEFdata`
platform or the `tematres` vocabulary server has been set up, this URLs need to
be changed accordingly, so the package communicates with the right servers (see
box below). 


```r
# list all options
bef.options()
```

```
## $url
## [1] "http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de"
## 
## $tematres_url

```r
# set credentials example
bef.options(user_credentials = "aÃ¶lkjspoiul12")
```



```r
# set URL example
bef.options(url = "http://my.own.befdata.instance.com")
```




* Caption:   
          The `bef.options()` is used to set and query the options of the `rbefdata`
          package. The options determine the behavior of the package. All options can be
          shown at once to get an overview as well as one can pick a single options to
          display the value it is set to. The options can be set using the names of their
          fields like shown here for example the "user_credentials" and the "URL".
  
### Discover Data 

For example looking for datasets that deal with the weight of plant organs we
use the terms "plant organ" and "weight" to query the `BEFdata` platform. It
returns a few (~10) datasets tagged with these keywords (see box xxx). In a
further step we use the `tematres` vocabulary integration to narrow down the
term "plant organ". We get back narrower terms like "leaf", "root", "twig" and
"stem" (see box xxx). These keywords are then to query the `BEFdata` server
again where it returns all datasets tagged with the narrower plant organ terms.
This method can be used the other way around as well to restrict the datasets
that get returned to higher order terms with `bef.tematres.api(task =
"fetchUp", "plant organ")` (see box xxx).


```r
# define the term plant organ
term_info = bef.tematres.api(task = "fetchNotes", "plant organ")
term_info
```

```
## $id
## [1] "74"
## 
## $term
## [1] "plant organ"
## 
## $language
## [1] "en"
## 
## $description
## [1] "In biology, an organ is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function."
```

```r

# get datasets tagged with plant organ
datasets_plant_organ = bef.get.datasets.for_keyword(c("plant organ", "weight"))

        The code box shows the use of the default `tematres` thesaurus used by the
        `rbefdata` package to improve the search of datasets on a `BEFdata` platform.
        Terms can be defined, narrowed or broadened to extend the search query for
        datasets against the `BEFdata` portal with the `bef.get.datasets.for_keyord()`
        command.

### Download data

The `rbefdata` package leverages access to data stored on a `BEFdata` platform.
It can fetch single datasets as well as it can load all associated datasets of
a proposal into the R environment in one single step. The latter functionality
returns a list object that keeps a data frame per list element containing one
dataset of a proposal each. The download functions requires either an ID of the
dataset or proposal to work, which can be found in the URLs (box xxx). If a
dataset is not open access the functions additionally require the
"user_credentials" to work as they check for the access rights before
downloading data.


```r
# the proposal URL shows the id is 90 http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/paperproposals/90
# http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/

# get datasets
datasets = bef.get.datasets.for_proposal(id = 90)

# extract second dataset
extract_second_dataset = datasets[[2]]

# show the first lines of the second dataset
head(extract_second_dataset, 5)

        The code box shows how to find the ID of the paper proposal and how to download
        the associated data into the R environment. As example the second dataset is
        extracted from the list that keeps the three datasets of the proposal and the
        first few lines of the dataset are displayed.

### Inspect data 

Each dataset on the `BEFdata` platform is associated with metadata which the
authors of the dataset provide. We can access the metadata trough `rbefdata`
directly by a metadata download function (requires the ID of dataset) or
extract it from a dataset after we have downloaded it already into R. The
second method is possible as each dataset is associated with its metadata on
download. The metadata is added as attributes to the data frame that can be
displayed using the R built-in `attributes()` command (see box xxx).


```r
# the URL of the dataset, ID (335) http://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/335

# get metadata by dataset ID
bef.portal.get.metadata(dataset = 335)$title
```

        The code box shows the two possible ways of getting metadata information for
        dataset provided on a BEFdata platform. First the meta data can be directly
        accessed by the `bef.portal.get.metadata()` command that needs the ID of
        dataset for download. The ID can be obtained from the URL of the dataset. As
        each dataset is associated with metadata on download it can be extracted by the
        R internal `attributes()` command.

The dataset list from the proposal contains three datasets, of which we only
use the second and third here. These two are written into two separate R
variables called `Nretention` and `design` before merging them. Inspecting the
headers of both datasets reveals that each of them contains a column with a
`plot_id` that seems suitable for merging. We make use of the metadata of the
columns to check if this really is the case.


```r
# extract into separate datasets
Nretention = datasets[[2]]
design = datasets[[3]]

          values for merging.

### Analyse data 

After merging the two datasets into a new synthesis dataset the data frame
still contains many columns that are not required for the analysis and thus can
be dropped. To analyse system N retention we need information about the species
diversity in the plots and about which plot is placed in which block from the
design dataset. 'Species diversity' is used as a factor containing three levels
(1,2,4 species mixtures). The response variables have been checked for
normality with `qqplot` and transformed as shown in the box below.

The data was analysed by linear mixed effects models. Since the plots are
nested in blocks, the block was used as a random factor. The analysis uses the
R packages `nlme` (Pinheiro et al. 2013) for modeling and `multcomp` (Hothorn
et al. 2008) for post-hoc comparisons. To adjust for an unbalanced experimental
design an ANOVA Type II was carried out to test for main effects using the R
package `car` (Fox and Weisberg 2011). The models have been evaluated visually.

### Results of the N retention analysis

System 15N retention (overall plot recovery) was positively affected by species
richness at the level of P = 0.0576 (Chisq: 5.7; Fig. Xa). The analysis of the
different system compartments (leaves, fine roots and soil) revealed that fine
root recovery was lower than leaf recovery, and biomass recovery (leaves and
fine roots) was lower than soil recovery. Whereas the relative leaf and root
recovery were significantly higher in species mixtures compared with
monoculture (Figs. Xb and Xc), the relative soil recovery was significantly
reduced (Fig. Xd). Thus, we could show that the relative N retention of biomass
was significantly increased in mixtures. For an interpretation of these results
we refer to Lang et al. 2013.

![plot of chunk anne_final_plot](figure/anne_final_plot.png) 


* caption: 
        Nitrogen (N) retention affected by species richness. N retention summed as the
        recovery of soil, roots and leaves (a), relative leaf recovery (b), relative
        root recovery (c) and relative soil recovery (d). Significant differences as
        revealed by post hoc Tukeyâ€™s test (P < 0.05) are indicated by different
        letters.

### Upload data 

Finally we need to decide on either to upload a full dataset which could be
done using the dataset upload function `bef.portal.upload.dataset()` or only to
upload the script and maybe a figure to highlight the road to the results from
the source datasets used. The second of which could be done by attaching to the
proposal with the command `bef.portal.attach.to_proposal()`. For the analysis
shown here, it is the best way to go with an attachment to the proposal as
uploading the merged dataset would only mean duplication of data in the
database of the `BEFdata` portal we upload to. So we upload the script and the
four pane figure with its caption to add them to the proposal. The figure is
prepared as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) using the R internal PNG device. It
is written to a temporary folder and then uploaded. The script in this case is
an R markdown file that we attach to the proposal (see box below).


```r
# attach the script using a path
bef.portal.attach.to_proposal(id = 90, attachment = "./rbefdata.Rmd", description = "The R script that has been used to derive the results in the published paper")
```

```
## [1] "Attachment to proposal with ID: 90 successful!"
```


* caption:  
        The script is attached to the proposal using the
        `bef.portal.attach.to_proposal()` command. It takes the id of the proposal, the
        file attachment, where we give a path to the location of the file, and a
        description as parameters.



```
## pdf 
##   2

* caption:  
          The plots are prepared and put together into a single four pane graphic. The
          plots are exported to hard drive using the R built-in Portable Networks
          Graphics (PNG) device.


```r
# caption of the figure

    description = caption)
```

```

          A description of the figure is written into a variable and the `rbefdata`
          command to attach to a proposal is used again to upload the exported four pane
          graphic to the proposal.

## Discussion

â€¢ Discussion: Point out the importance of the results and place them in the context of previous studies and in relation to the application of the work (expanding on the Synthesis and applications section of the Summary). Where appropriate, set out recommendations for management or policy.

* structure of intro
  * many data
  * reuse
  * metadata 
  * data search
  * preprocessing with semantics integrated
  * wrapup (metadata/paper proposals/workflows)

* potential structure of discussion?
  * Data life cycle 
  * Data preservation
  * Metadata 
  * Data exploration/processing
  * Metadata 
  * Semantics 
  * Taxonomies
  * BEFdata and rbefdata solutions

Even though the situation with data preservation has been improved by online
data management platforms, there is still many valuable data lost (long tail).
One one hand this is related to the fact that researchers are reluctant to use
online data management tools, as they fear to loose the control over their data
and on the other hand to the fact that most research projects do not have a
data preservation plan that would force the contributors to preserve their
data. More general this is related to no direct benefit to data providers for
sharing data online and that it usually only means to put more effort into the
data after the results have been published already. However the availability of
a broad range of data and useful metadata describing it is essential to
different aspects of the life cycle of data. In ecology the integration of
available data offers the potential to answer some of the most pressing global
relevant questions like for example about the global climate change and the
maintainability of vital ecosystem services. 

* BEFdata and rbefdata solutions
  * set incentives for data preservation
    * acknowledgement
    * contribution to upcoming papers 
    * data publishing (citable) 
  * use common tools transfer to metadata standards 
    * metadata from spreadsheets to EML  
  * reproducibility  
    * preservation of scripts as attachments to proposals/datasets

To further improve the situation on one hand is a strict policy related to
funding    

This requires efficient tools that not only help to access the data but also to
process it and to preserve data products and results including how they have
been derived to be fully reproducible as scripts or workflows

less effort has been put into preservation of algorithms and workflows that
researchers use to derive their data products and results.

The software combination `rbefdata` and `BEFdata` provides solutions to many of
these aspects of data management like data preservation, online data sharing
and discussion of ideas, data processing, intensive use of meta data and the
preservation of workflows used to derive results which is important for
reproducibility and provenance that in turn is again a crucial component to
provide effective incentives in form of acknowledgements for data providers.  
 
The `BEFdata` platform serves as a scratch pad for research data as well as it
covers the preservation of data. It offers data harmonization tools, metadata
support via the Ecological Metadata Language standard and a social component
that fosters sharing data online (cite Karin). The `rbefdata` package enables
access to the data and metadata on the platform as well as it provides upload
functionality right from within the R environment 

Lost a high amount of valuable data as researchers are still reluctant to give
away their data. One possible solution to this would be to make data
preservation obligatory and make it a condition for sponsorship of projects.


One one hand there is many
data already available. And on the other hand many data is still lost.

This requires the reuse and integration of mostly small and heterogeneous data.

Even though the situation gets better there is still many data lost as
researchers are reluctant to use online data preservation tools as they fear to
loose the control over their data.

to preserve data products and
attachments that are generated on analysing data.  The tag based exploration of
datasets of the BEFdata platform improves the exploration of relevant data for
a certain analysis and the `tematres` vocabulary integration further supports
this. It allows to retrieve term definitions as well as relations to broaden or
narrow down search terms along a hierarchy. 

While well described data helps a lot in understanding datasets and on
deciding upon the relevance and applicability of data for a certain analysis
there is still lots of manual intervention necessary to prepare the data for
analysis (cite Karin and me? or xxx). It may needs to be cleaned, imputed,
reshaped and merged which usually takes up to 70% of an analysis workflow,
before smart models can be applied to the data to find interesting patters
(cite the workflow paper of Karin and me). This preparatory steps not only are
time and labour intensive but also potentially error prone, especially as the
complexity of the analyses increases. Provenance and the advantage of keeping
scripts (workflows) close to the data.



In ecology the reuse of the mostly small and heterogeneous data seems
promising. It can be integrated into a wider context to answer questions on a
much broader, temporal and spatial scale. 

This is of particular intrest in terms of the most pressing questions in
ecology

about climate changes and
ecosystem services. This requires several 

There is a growing demand to reuse available data and for tools that enable
researchers to deal with requirements like data preservation, exploration and
reuse as well as with the description process of data via meta data.  

 However, particularly research areas like ecology
which are characterised by a high degree of interdisciplinary interactions are
challenging in terms of data management and the applicability of some valuable
concepts like ontologies seems questionable. While ontologies with a very clear
and close scope are in use already (onto verse examples) the development of a
sophisticated ontology for ecology research is a very time, labor intensive and
complex task. The nature of ecology requires a community for the development of
ontologies that includes experts from all contributing domains to model the
relevant concepts into a formal representation.

(supporting, Kepler).






`rbefdata` makes scripting a workflow to pull data for analysis and push back
results and scripts simple. The upload mechanism can help to keep the data
management platform up to date and gives other researchers the possibility to
reproduce results by downloading scripts attached to proposals or datasets. An
uploaded script is not only a stepping stone to reproducible research but also
helps to track down data provenance which can be interesting in terms of
acknowledgement for data providers in a more fine grained view. 

While it seems a waste of time and bandwidth on one hand to always transfer the
data to a local script for processing, this approach also has its upsides.
Having the data locally offers full flexibility in choice of tools and also
enables the researcher to freely mix in other local data sources. While this
approach works well for small data it does not for big data since the transfer
of data is not possible for large sized data. The recent trend here is
on-server/in-database statistics, a scenario where scripts are to be sent to
the server before it returns the answer after processing (xxx). To keep the
`BEFdata` platform as flexible as possible and to give the researchers the
freedom of choice this could be one of the future features to be integrated. 



### rbefdata makes metadata available within the R environment

`rbefdata` is innovative in that it
provides data together with metadata in the R environment.


### keeping workflow scripts close to the data: Provenance


Clarify: controlled vocabulary - thesaurus - ontology. Controlled vocabulary
for finding and sorting, ontology for automatic reasoning.

* Semantics for searching and sorting

We decided not to develop functionality to develop nested controlled
vocabularies within BEFdata. This decision was based on the fact that there
are already sophisticated frameworks and software to develop and maintain
vocabularies. Linking to external vocabularies has the additional advantage
that several data repositories can simultaneously use the same thesaurus for
tagging their data. This keeps single repositories small and coherent without
loosing the potential to link them to other repositories (linked data,
citations for linked data).

* Semantics for automated reasoning


This is a separate argument, and we do not touch it in the results: automatic
merging should be only in the discussion:

but also could be used in the process of integrating the data
for analysis. 

Additionally it can be error prone especially if analyses get more complex and
require the expertise of more than one research domain.  


Ontologies, as formal representations of knowledge, potentially offer a
sophisticated tool to deal with that step of data preparation (e.g michener et al 2012). 
While they are already used in some research domains like genetics (cite xxx, eg. http://www.geneontology.org/),
other domains face more problems using it (cite xxx, morpho team announced
semantic tagging but the plug-in did not appear anywhere). The application of
ontologies in ecology is discussed controversially (cite xxx) and it is argued
that they can be a huge benefit, but it is hard to set up a sophisticated
ontology covering all necessary terms and relation of a highly complex research
domain (cite xxx).


We recently started to develop an ontology using a `tematres` .The
formalization we develop will be based on the knowledge used in biodiversity
ecosystem functioning research. 

The `BEFdata` platform will get a semantical tagging feature that will allow data
owners to tag data fine granular ?? on data column level. Using the same
formalized knowledge from the ontology we will be able to provide smart merging
and transformation features within the `rbefdata` package that help researchers
to merge datasets semi automatic.

While data storage and description is almost the same for all kind of data the
effective interlinking of data via an ontology requires the development of a
common terminology. The terminology should not only be accepted but used, developped and discussed
by all contributing scientist of the project. The future goal on ontologies is of
course the development of domain ontologies that can be interlinked to an
overarching ontology. Thus, collaborative ontology
engineering approaches like `ontoverse` (Zoulfa El Jerroudi et al. 2008) or
`tematres` are highly valuable as they not only help to set up ontologies but
also to develop and maintain them over time even if the researchers change that
contribute to it.

The package enables access to data and metadata stored on the platform as well
as it  the dataset exploration by the integration of an online thesaurus. 

It tightly integrates the metadata into R data frames so it can be accessed
directly when processing data from the portal.  `rbefdata` includes an access
to an online thesaurus that can be used to improve the discovery of datasets
stored on the portal. Furthermore it provides upload functionality so any data
product can be pushed directly back to the data portal for preservation. We
integrate data management concepts like a semantic improved exploration of
datasets, a seamless access to data and metadata and the preservation of data
products directly into the R environment.   


The `BEFdata` platform offers a keyword based search for datasets that is made
available from within the `rbefdata` package as well by the
`bef.get.datasets.for_keyword()` command.  Thus we can use the vocabulary
integration to enhance the exploration of datasets along the relations provided
by the vocabulary server.  



Today ecologists have access to a huge amount of environmental and historic
data. This puts much pressure on the development of tools that enable
researchers to explore, process, reuse as well as to preserve derived data
products and their provenance traces. Although there are many tools and
concepts available already in data management that provide features that cover
almost the whole life cycle of data, only a few of them are widely spread or
accepted throughout ecology. This is related to different reasons like for
example a lack of benefit for researchers to prepare and share data online and
the fear to give away and loose the control over the data.  However there are
still many small projects in ecology that do not have a sophisticated data
management at all and many data simply get lots over time.

The preparation of datasets for long term preservation and online sharing is
time intensive and in most cases involves the learning of new tools that
support the process. Thus the tight integration integration of data management
concepts into widely used software tools like for example the R statistics
environment. 

This situation can be
improved by the tight integration of data management concepts into existing and
widely used software and thus into the daily workflow of researchers but also
through concepts that help researchers gain trust in online data management
platforms.  Paper proposals and data provenance as a way to promote
collaborations by the discussion of ideas and, metadata to improve data
preservation and information exchange as well as the integration of semantic
resources to enhance data exploration and processing, only represent a few
examples of concepts with the potential to improve the progress of a data
intensive scientific domain like ecology. The `rbefdata` R package together
with the data management platform `BEFdata` combine the strengths of the data
management concepts mentioned into a sophisticated data management software
package that makes use of widely accepted tools in ecology.


The use and reuse of available data is promising as the integration offers the
opportunity to answer questions on broad temporal and spatial scale. 


The `rbefdata` package (GitHub: https://github.com/befdata/befdata) is a
companion to the open source data management platform `BEFdata`. The latest
stable version of `rbefdata` can be installed via the CRAN package repository.
`rbefdata` is part of the rOpenSci initiative (http://ropensci.org/) which aims
to provide the R statistics environment with packages that enable the seamless
access to scientific data repositories (cite rOpenSci). Basically the
`rbefdata` package enables access to data and metadata stored on a `BEFdata`
platform as well as it allows the upload of data products. The integration of a
`tematres` vocabulary server allows for an improved exploration of datasets.
The `tematres` vocabulary server can hold different representations of
vocabularies as it provides support for thesauri, taxonomies or ontologies. The
`rbefdata` package by default integrates the vocabulary of the BEF-China
experiment stored on a `tematres` server (url xxx). By the time of writing the
taxonomy on the server contains xxx terms used in biodiversity research. The
relations of terms provided by the `tematres` vocabulary can be used to improve
the search of relevant data for an analysis. 


Before data can effectively be reused it may need to be cleaned, imputed,
reshaped and merged which usually takes up to 70% of an analysis (Garijo 2012,
Pfaff 2013 in prep). These preparatory steps are not only time and labour
intensive but also potentially error prone, especially if the amount and
complexity of data to be included increases. The integration of ontologies can
help to solve these problems (michener 2008). As ontologies allow the machine
readable access to knowledge of a scientific domain they can be used to develop
tools that "understand" the contents of datasets and guide researchers on the
process of data preparation. While ontologies with a narrow and clear scope are
very well used already (cite xxx, e.g gene Ontology) it is a challenging tasks
to create an ontology for research domains like ecology that are characterized
by a high degree of interdisciplinary interactions (Parsons 2011). This
characteristic leads to a heterogeneous landscape of knowledge and concepts
that would need to be covered and formalized by the ontology.


As the `BEFdata` platform is open source each project can set up an own
instance profit from the data sharing and preservation offers data preservation
and harmonizing functionality.  The `rbefdata` package enables an easy access
to the data preservation from within R and the   




We discuss `rbefdata` and `BEFdata` in in the light of current and future
challenges for data management give an outlook onto upcoming features that
could help to solve them. 

The data here is mainly provided by small scale studies spread all over the
world (e.g heidorn2009 shedding light on the dark) but also through bigger long
term projects like LTER (cite xxx), BEF-China (cite xxx), governmental projects
and local initiatives (cite xxx) and private persons. This in fact results in a
wild growing, complex and heterogeneous data landscape that an ontology would
need to capture to be usable.

### intro karin

Karin:

thesauri, ontologies, etc. ... 

Something on data discovery and paper
proposals: Interdisciplinary analyses depend on data coming from different
research fields. Not one single research project or laboratory measures all
data, but they come from different researchers.  Data discovery - finding data
that is suitable to answer a pressing question - has become an integral part of
science. Data discovery between scientific disciplines is hampered by different
vocabularies and missing agreement on common semantics. Tools addressing this
problem are

etc. Cite our paper on workflows.

 (http://ropensci.org/),
which is a community driven approach to wrap all science APIs and to create
solutions for R users to seamlessly pull data from different repositories
spread over the internet into R for analysis.  


### material and methods 

Karin: 
- I would suggest to reduce the details of the following dramatically:

The Main experiment was established in 2009 and 2010 as the first large scale
forest biodiversityâ€“ecosystem functioning experiment in the highly species-rich
subtropics.  In total, the area covers 50 ha and there are 566 plots of 400
trees each, ranging in diversity from monoculture to 24-species mixtures. The
experiment used 42 native tree species and 10 shrub species, combined into
different species pools. More than 400 000 tree and shrub saplings were
planted.  In a parallel observational approach, a total of 27 Comparative Study
Plots (CSPs) of 30x30 m each were set up in existing forests in the adjacent
Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (Zhejiang Province) in 2008.  The
observational plots were selected according to a crossed sampling design along
tree species richness and stand age. The CSPs address the impact of
successional age on ecosystem functioning, providing a basis for assessing the
successional processes at work across tree species diversity in the Main
Experiment . 



### Data processing and integration

* sharing ideas for analysis: paper proposals 
      Paper proposals are an emerging concept solving transparant data exchange and
      reuse across disciplines and laboratories [citations!]


* Introducing workflows (merits, ROpenSci, Kepler, Pegasus, etc.) Cite our paper on workflows.
* Workflow repositories and software 
* R needs to be learned as well that is no argument to less acceptance of other tools like Kepler, is there?!
* Provenance and the advantage of keeping scripts (workflows) close to the data.


### Wrap up (introduce solutions)

Especially for highly interdisciplinary research domains this requires the
input of many scientists and discussions about definitions and relations of
terms in the representation.  This might be one of the reasons why there is a
lack of sophisticated ontologies especially for highly interdisciplinary
research domains like ecology. 




Karin: there are some papers talking about what users want from data
repositories. These could be cited (e.g. Kerstin Bach). Motivate that
researchers prefer to perform the analyses at their own laptops.


While data preservation and the access to data for a wider audience are covered
very well, the use of metadata and semantic concepts, which both are related to
the efficient reuse of data lacks behind.  On one hand this is related to the
reluctance of users to use new tools or the fear to loose control over valuable
data. But on the other hand this is also related to the fact that the valuable
concepts are not yet tightly integrated enough into the researchers daily
workflow.



* intro summary frame

A multitude of data management and knowledge platforms are emerging which
contribute to a growing global data pool. The need to effectively reuse the
available data, grows with the data pool. This puts much pressure on the
development of tools that tightly integrate valuable concepts into existing and
widely accepted tools and into the workflows of researchers to help them
dealing with the upcoming challenges in data management and analysis.

* data preservation -> many data available
